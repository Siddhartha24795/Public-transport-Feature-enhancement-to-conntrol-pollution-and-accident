# Public-transport-Feature-enhancement-to-conntrol-pollution-and-accident
It explains features that must be added to public transport in order to make people use public transport instead of their own vehicle thus controlling the pollution and less accident

#Objective: To develop a Web app for making the public transport
system more convenient and accessible for everyone.

#Implementation Details: Our implementation details include to
develop a WebApp which would include the following features. The
features are listed below:

#Tech Stack Used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, ReactJS, Django, Node.

#Step 1: User registration through app.

a) Ask for all the necessary details of the users and verify user through
Aadhar card.

b) For first time users, provide 50% off on first 5 rides, so that they get
attracted and travel and get to understand the difference between
existing previous public transport and the new one.

#Step 2: Ask user for pick up and Drop location, also special option for
non-stop service. When users books a service shows the users the
following details of the means of public transport they are taking :

a) Show bus no. of all the buses travelling through that route + their live
location + their reaching time to pick up location + Final time to reach
at destination using live traffic. Also, show complete route so that users
in case needs a drop in between he can take.

b) In case of metro/local trains show their time at pick up location, also
their time at destination.

c) Show vacant seats in the buses travelling through that pathway.

d) Show priority in booking like window seat (first time visitor) etc.,
according to user preference.e)Keep some non-stop (No halt) service buses for some frequently used
destinations like to railway station or airports for quick arrival without
wastage of time.

#Step 3: Show the total cost and the credits earned. Credits are earned
by the users for as for each 3km they would earn 1 credits. (2credits =
1Rs). These credits can be used by the users for the next ride or transfer
amount to their bank account. Also show the following details at the
end of the trip:

a) Show public transport cost and comparison stats with ola, uber etc.
Also, show comparative time analysis which is just same as private
ones.

b) Total money saved.

#Step 4: Show various offers, coupons available
a) Show off due to festive seasons etc.

b) Show offers in circular trip this will be beneficial for society aunts,
office persons etc.

c) Offers for family booking, booking more than one seat at a time (Cost
around .80 times of total cost)

d) Offers for monthly users/ passes.

#Step 5: Payment portal

a) One payment portal/Smart Card for all public transport payments.
That can get recharged online or at fixed stations like Metros.

b) Pay for entire trip at one time even if there are breaks in between.
Like after drop from bus travelling through government E-rickshaw for
door to door dropping, cost is also included in that payment.

Step 6: Extra Functionalities

a) Pre-booking some days before option. Show notification in case bus
is late + show alternative options (alternate buses if seats available)
with real time bus details.

b) Provide small offers if public services used frequently.

c) Add option for chat/help in case of any query/conflicts.

d) Driver Feedback.

e) Driver rating.

f) Option for refund in case of any problem like bus is late by more than
1hr and user is not looking for alternative (Add this like vikalp in Trains)
or in case due to some reason user cancels journey, deduct some
amount of money only.

g) Credits to driver based on his rating and time and km he driven.
Expenses: Camera + GPS device (Total cost is around 1200-1500), this
amount is even less than profit earned per day by any public transport
so net no expense is required, only some part of profit of a day is
exploited.

#Problems in public transportation ans their solution that we would
provide through use of WebApp:

a) Security: Private transport has a risk of security as you are travelling
with unknown driver(ola, uber) in case you donâ€™t have your own
vehicle. Here, we are providing camera with real time monitoring, so in
case of any problem, user can press emergency button in the app andrecordings in the camera can be seen by nearest police station and
other members thus enhanced security.

b) Door to door service : Public transport lacks feature of door to door
service, this facility can be added by providing E-rickshaw at such
points. If someone is having good he prefers private vehicle , but Erickshaw connecting doors to main tracks solves this issue. Payment is
done through portal only at one time. Show vacant seats in these small
vehicles also while you are in bus. No pollution, also less traffic caused.

#Features that public transport was lacking in comparison to private
transport + some some new features :

a) Live seat display, time to reach destination, next pick up time,
alternatives available to travel with corresponding time, use of live
traffic.

b) Live seat booking with preferences like window seat for first time
visitors in the city based of their location detection or allotting to users
who selected window seat as preference.

c) Cancellation in case bus is late with full refund + other case in which
you miss the bus with some deduction in money.

d) Current booking like nowadays in trains current option opens after
chart is prepared, thus if seat is vacant, or some cancels in the end or
no boards in the bus that will be in current booking.

e) Seat reservation in case you are women, senior citizen, emergency
quota or front seats in case you suffer from vomiting and other such
health issues.

f) Relatively very cheap to travel- around (1/10)th of cost with private
mode.

g) Speed Display : Live speed display, thus in case driver crossing limits,
you can draft complain.

h) Route display : Display routes in the app that bus will follow + stick
the route such that if someone wants to have a drop in between he/she
can take.

I) Ride Credits/ Festive Credit: Those who travel more give them credit
monthly basis, also over every ride. Even provide Credits to users
during festivals.

j) One Payment Mode : for all kind of transportation- metro, buses, Erickshaws, one mode of payment through portal/smart card. No
separate payment even for door to door services. Provide offers while
recharging.

#Optional features that can be added to WebApp:

a) Exploiting private vehicles to make them public : Allow people to add
their vehicles as public transport by registering through this app, now
areas in which only few people travel like 5-7 at a time these vehicles
can be used , also they can earn money easily.

b)For non-halt fast services these small vehicles with 5-7 person at a
time can be used.

c) While going to office owner can take other persons thus earn money
easily, dropping those who has destinations in between thus less traffic,
less pollution, least use of cars, No late to office.

d) Some Unauthorized owners have hundreds of buses/cars and they
pay very less to drivers, thus we can give rough estimate to drivers
along with incentives + Credits for every ride and with some fixed kms.Thus, situation can be controlled and we can get experienced drivers
easily.

e) Add comfortable seats in buses + One TV for entertainment, also
reduce prices of AC buses with more no. of AC buses on the road.

f) Make offers at early credits and thus the use the interest of stored
amount for better facilities in public means.

#Application: This WebApp can be used by every users to have
convenient and comfortable ride while they are taking the public
transport services. This would help users for last mile communication
through this WebApp the users can get the live location of each of the
public transport services.
